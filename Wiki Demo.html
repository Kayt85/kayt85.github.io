    <p ><b style='color: blue; font-family: cursive; font-size: 25px'>The Shure SM7</b> is a professional cardioid dynamic microphone, commonly
       used in broadcasting applications since 1973. Designed by Shure, it has been described as an
       "iconic" industry standard microphone for its focused, directional sound and its widespread adoption
       in radio, television and recording studios. In 2007–2008, the SM7B model became popular for professional podcasting.
       Shure designed the Unidyne microphone element in 1939, then greatly improved it in 1959, based on research
       and development by Shure engineer Ernie Seeler. The smaller Unidyne III appeared six years later, designed by
       Seeler to be the transducer inside the SM series of microphones, including the popular SM56, SM57 and SM58, used
        live on stage and in the recording studio. "SM" stands for "Studio Microphone".[3]
       Adapting the Unidyne III element for increased bass response, Seeler designed the large and heavy SM5 microphone
       in 1966, intended for broadcasting applications such as for announcers in radio stations and television studios.
       In 1973, the SM5 was updated and reduced in size to become the SM7, which was widely adopted in radio and TV, but
       occasionally used in recording studios. Compared to the SM57, the SM7 has a flatter (more neutral) frequency response,
       but also has two recessed switches for tailoring the response curve. One switch is a high-pass filter to reduce low
       frequency rumble, and the other is a mid-frequency reduction to attenuate and flatten out the SM7's inherent "presence" peak.[4][5]

      <p><b style=' color: blue; font-family: cursive; font-size: 25px'>Audio-Technica</b> was established in 1962 in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, by
        Hideo Matsushita as a phonograph cartridge manufacturer. Its first products were the AT-1 and the AT-3 MM stereo phono
        cartridges. Business rapidly developed and Audio-Technica expanded into other fields. The headquarters and factory moved in
        1965 to the current address in Naruse, Machida, Tokyo.[1] In 1969, the company began exporting phono cartridges worldwide
        and launched the first microcassette recorders.[2]In 1972, Audio-Technica established its US arm in Fairlawn, Ohio, and started
        shipping VM phono cartridges to European manufacturers. In 1974, the company developed its first headphones, the AT-700 series,
        launched the same year. The AT-800 series of microphones were introduced in 1978 and in the same year the UK establishment in Leeds began operation.[1]
        In the 1980s, with the growth in digital music formats threatening their core business of phonograph cartridges, Audio-Technica
        begun a period of diversification. Employee suggestions were solicited, with sushi machines among the ideas selected for further development.[3]
        In 1984, Audio-Technica introduced the ASM50 Nigirikko, a nigiri-forming appliance for home kitchens, which incorporated a
        turn-table like mechanism to deposit the nigiri onto.[3][4] The market success of this product led the company to develop a
        range of sushi machinery for commercial and industrial use.[3] Audio-Technica remains one of the largest manufacturers of sushi machines globally today, with products marketed under the brand AUTEC.[3][4]
        In 1986, the company developed RCA cables with high-purity copper produced from the continuous metal casting process (PCOCC),
        invented and developed between 1982 and 1985 by Atsumi Ohno.[5] In the same year, the company launched the AT33ML/OCC phono cartridge,
        the first made with PCOCC materials. In 1988, another Audio-Technica subsidiary is founded in Taiwan.[1]

          <p><b style=' color: blue; font-family: cursive; font-size: 25px'>Røde Microphones</b> (/ˈroʊd/; stylised RØDE) is an Australian audio technology company that designs and manufactures microphones and related accessories,
            audio interfaces and consoles, and audio software. It is recognised as a world-leader in several audio categories across consumer, prosumer and professional
            markets,[2] specialising in products for music recording, location sound recording, broadcast and podcasting, filmmaking, and content creation.
            RØDE is the flagship brand of the Freedman Group, which began operations in 1967 as Freedman Electronics and has since acquired several audio companies, including SoundField,
            APHEX and Event Electronics. It is headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with offices around the world including the USA and China, and exports its products to 118 countries globally.
            Freedman Electronics was established in 1967 by husband and wife Henry and Astrid Freedman.[4] Originally from London, Henry Freedman relocated to Stockholm and started a family.
            Working as a chief engineer for a telecommunications company, Freedman would do after-hours servicing and modifications for a local agent of German pro-audio manufacturer Dynacord.
            In time, he was offered the Australian distribution rights to sell the brand,[6] and as a result migrated there in 1966 with his family, including his son, Peter.[7]Setting up a shop
            in the suburb of Ashfield near Sydney, Freedman Electronics was one of the first companies in the city to design, manufacture, install and service audio products, including loudspeakers, amplifiers and microphones.[8]
            Henry died in 1987, and his son Peter took over the business. He invested heavily in growing Freedman Electronics' sound installation services, but his limited business experience combined
             with a difficult economy in the late 1980s almost bankrupted the company and left Peter in a considerable amount of financial debt.[9]
