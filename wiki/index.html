    <p ><b style=' font-size: 25px'>The Shure SM7</b> is a professional cardioid dynamic microphone, commonly
       used in broadcasting applications since 1973. Designed by Shure, it has been described as an
       "iconic" industry standard microphone for its focused, directional sound and its widespread adoption
       in radio, television and recording studios. In 2007–2008, the SM7B model became popular for professional podcasting.
       Shure designed the Unidyne microphone element in 1939, then greatly improved it in 1959, based on research
       and development by Shure engineer Ernie Seeler. The smaller Unidyne III appeared six years later, designed by
       Seeler to be the transducer inside the SM series of microphones, including the popular SM56, SM57 and SM58, used
        live on stage and in the recording studio. "SM" stands for "Studio Microphone".
       Adapting the Unidyne III element for increased bass response, Seeler designed the large and heavy SM5 microphone
       in 1966, intended for broadcasting applications such as for announcers in radio stations and television studios.
       In 1973, the SM5 was updated and reduced in size to become the SM7, which was widely adopted in radio and TV, but
       occasionally used in recording studios. Compared to the SM57, the SM7 has a flatter (more neutral) frequency response,
       but also has two recessed switches for tailoring the response curve. One switch is a high-pass filter to reduce low
       frequency rumble, and the other is a mid-frequency reduction to attenuate and flatten out the SM7's inherent "presence" peak.

      <p><b style=' font-size: 25px'>The SM7</b> is one of three very popular microphones in radio and television stations,
        used by deejays and voice-over announcers. The other two are the American Electro-Voice RE20 (1968) and the German
        Sennheiser MD 421 (1960). The Sennheiser and Electro-Voice models are used widely on the concert stage and in recording
        studios.[6] The EV RE20 was updated to the RE27N/D.Portrayed on television in the early 1990s, the SM7 was seen in
        the series about the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska: Northern Exposure with KHBR radio deejay Chris Stevens (John Corbett)
       providing commentary and narration for each episode. The microphone was used without its windscreen, revealing the extended
       metal grille protecting the microphone element. The typical radio station mounts the microphone in this manner, hanging
       from a robust boom arm extending out over the workspace.

          <p><b style=' font-size: 25px'>The wide</b> frequency response of the SM7, and its ability to withstand high sound
            pressure level (SPL), have led audio engineers to use it in the recording studio, to pick up a variety of sources such
            as horns, vocals, electric guitar and bass guitar amplifiers, and parts of the drum kit—especially bass drum or "kick".
            The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger's vocals were recorded in the mid-1970s with two microphones—an SM7 and a condenser microphone—with
            one or the other chosen during mixdown, or a combination of the two.Engineer-producer Bruce Swedien used several
            microphones including the SM7 to record Michael Jackson's vocals for Thriller in 1982. The SM7 was the only vocal microphone
            on "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)", and was probably used for "Billie Jean", according to Swedien's session notes. Swedien
            owned six SM7s, and was a big fan of its sound. He also used the SM7 in 1981 for James Ingram singing "Just Once".
            Because it can handle high dynamic range, the SM7 has been used for heavy metal vocalists. The 1982 album The Number of the Beast by Iron
            Maiden employed an SM7 for the vocals of Bruce Dickinson. In 2001–2003, the SM7 was used to record the voice of singer-guitarist James
            Hetfield for the Metallica album St. Anger, as seen in the documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. The 2008 Black Ice album by
            AC/DC was supervised by producer Mike Fraser who chose the SM7 for Brian Johnson's "crooning" vocals.
            Other recordings using the SM7 include Jack White of the White Stripes working with engineer Joe Chiccarelli starting with Icky Thump in 2007,
            and engineer Michael Barbiero choosing the SM7 in combination with other microphones for Whitney Houston in 1983–1984, heard on her debut
            album in 1985. Bassist-engineer Michael Bradford put an SM7 in front of Kid Rock for the album "The History of Rock" in 2000; he had
            learned of the SM7 from Gerard Smerek who used it on Bob Seger and Anita Baker. Sheryl Crow sang into an SM7 for The Globe Sessions
            in 1998, and Bob Dylan has recorded with it, starting with Love and Theft engineered by Chris Shaw in 2001. The vocals of Red Hot Chili
            Peppers' Anthony Kiedis in "Give It Away" were recorded into an SM7 in 1991, as were the vocals of Maroon 5's Adam Levine on "This Love",
            recorded in 2002. Donald Glover used the SM7 for some songs on the Childish Gambino Camp album in 2011.
